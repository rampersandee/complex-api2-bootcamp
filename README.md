# ðŸ“Š Project: Complex API 2

### Goal: Use data returned from one api to make a request to another api and display the data returned

### Process:

<ol>
  <li>This one was done in haste, in all honesty.</li>
  <li>Playing with APIs is messy business.  My original idea was to have the user input an animal and take the location of that input on the API and usi t to generate an image of their habitat with another API.</li>
  <li>The API would not work.  Broke my heart, truly.</li>
   <li>But, this made it clear that I had to move on to something less taxing.</li>
  <li>I found a Pokemon API and took the type of a pokemon.  This type was then taken and placed into another API that was looking specifically for the food a pokemon would eat (I coded each type to have a certain food i.e, bug and grass types ate grass, electric types ate wires).</li>
  <li>I viewed this as a quick exercise.  I was lacking on time, so I had to get it done and this was simple enough to get done and pushed.</li> 

<p>Overall, It's simple.  It wasn't really anything too spectacular.  It just satisfied the needs of the project.  Get 'er done, as they say..</p>

<ul>
  <li>I completed the challenge: | 5 <em>Completed.  That's it.</em></li>
  <li>I feel good about my code: | 2 <em>Just boring.  I could do more, but once again, the time got me.  That and the fact my original idea didn't turn out as I had planned.  Boooooo.</em></li>
</ul>
